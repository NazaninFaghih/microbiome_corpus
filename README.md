# Natural Language Processing Project

This is part of an NLP project which focuses on named entity recognition(NER) of microbiome entities from PubMed publications. A Taxonomic Rank dictionary was created after analysing, cleaning and processing data from NCBI. Then, an annotation pipeline was created to annotate the publications using string matching with the created dictionary and some rule-based methods. Finally, the annotated publications were used to train deep learning models.
